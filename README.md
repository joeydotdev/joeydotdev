Heya, I'm Joey.

Tech stuff:

- I'm a software engineer located in San Francisco, CA.
- I work at Uber where I write lots of code for stuff on UberEats. Most of my work these days is around building out new bets for the business.
- I founded [cscareers.dev](https://cscareers.dev) - a Discord community targeted towards software engineers landing their first role in tech.

Non tech stuff:
- Huge gamer. Usually playing either RuneScape or League of Legends.
- Frequent raver. Mostly listening to house/trance/techno.
- Corgi fan. Don't think this needs any justification. iykyk
